# Final Project

The purpose of this assignment is to analyze the correlation between users' age and occupation vs their credit score. This analysis would help us determine if there is a strong correlation between age and income in relation to user's credit scores.

## Problem Statement
Working as data scientists in a global finance company. Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered significant credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into the credit score brackets to reduce the manual effort required.

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score. 

### Initial ideas for questions we want to answer

- Is there a strong correlation between age and credit score?
- Is there a strong correlation for a 
- Is there a connection between being xyz and having a better credit score?
- Do we need to add more data to get a higher accuracy score when using a machine learning model?â€¨

### Group communication protocols
- Throughout this project the group will communicate through our group slack channel, and WhatsApps as needed.
- This will including sharing information that we find online, code, cleaning up data, aligning on individual tasks, and arranging meetings at least once per week.

### Getting started

We begin the project by deciding on our topic of finance and searching Kaggle for possible datasets that would provide us with enough columns and rows of data in order to glean insights. 

Credit Score classification has a Usability score of 9.41 with a test.csv file of 15.37 MiB including 27 columns  data that could be of interest for our problem statement including age, occupation, annual income, etc.
