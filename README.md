# Final Project

The purpose of this assignment is to analyze salary prediction classification data, and classification on salary whether less than 50K or greater than 50k. The dataset was pulled from Kragger, the original source is from the US Census database.

## Problem Statement
TBD - Initial ideas - prediction task to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score. 

### Initial ideas for questions we want to answer in predicting a specific target:

- Is there a corelation between education and salaries above or below 50K/yr?
- Prediction of salary based on other demographic indicators. 
- Are there indicators/categories that can accurately predict whether or not an individual will make above 50K/yr?

### Group communication protocols
- Throughout this project the group will communicate through our group slack channel, and WhatsApps as needed.
- This will including sharing information that we find online, code, cleaning up data, aligning on individual tasks, and arranging meetings at least once per week.

### Team Members

### Getting started

We begin the project we searched on Kaggle for possible datasets that would provide us with a robust machine learning dataset to solve for a binary classification problem. 

We located the [Salary Prediction Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayessa/salary-prediction-classification) dataset that is 3.84 MiB, with 15 columns including information such as age, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, and other categories that will provide us with meaningful insights for our marchine learning project and analysis. 

### Tools and Resources Used

- [Salary Prediction Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayessa/salary-prediction-classification) dataset
- GitHub
- Jupyter Notebook

To Do:

- Description of preliminary data preprocessing 
- Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision-making process
- Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
